### About
I'm the guy you know as **Jack of all trades, Master of none**, although I am doing pretty well in CP and development. I'll just list some of the areas I've explored,
- SpeedCubing (with personal best of 8.78s on 3x3 rubiks cube)
- Teakwondo (technically I should be a redbelt)
- Competitive Math (3 times nationalist)
- 3D modeling (decent with blender)
- Callisthenics (currently active, umm I can hold straddle planche for 2 seconds)
- Origamy, Sketching and just being the cousin everyone's jealous of.
